# Coalfields-Project
Practice project in scraping, profiling, cleaning and analysing data from the Northern Mine Research Society website.
All materials are created 'experimentally', exploring the concepts and techniques required to conduct this processing as a learning experience in the first instance.
The purpose of the coalfields project is twofold:
1. It's a test bed as I upskill and develop previous experience around data harvesting, profiling, cleanning and analysing - honing skills, knowledge and prectices etc..
2. The coalfields project is to specifically create data analyses looking at demographics and deprivation in identified mining communities.
